SMARTPHONE LOCATION RECOGNITION: FEATURE SELECTION AND DATASET STRUCTURE
================================================================================

1. DATASET OVERVIEW
-------------------
The dataset is structured as a MATLAB table containing 178 columns. 
The data is derived from tri-axial accelerometer (Acc) and gyroscope (Gyr) 
signals, processed using 10-second non-overlapping windows.

- Columns 1 to 156: Signal features (Time, Frequency, and Time-Frequency domains).
- Columns 157 to 178: Experimental metadata and ground truth (e.g., Position, 
  Activity, SubjectID, DeviceModel).

2. FEATURE SELECTION PROCESS
----------------------------
To optimize classification performance and reduce dimensionality, the original 
feature space was reduced as follows (see scripts/test_SPR.m):

A. Initial Exclusion: Columns 88 to 93 (representing cross-correlation 
   coefficients between sensor axes) were excluded from the training phase.
B. Final Selection: A subset of 50 high-impact features was selected based on 
   feature importance ranking. These 50 variables form the input vector for the 
   recognition model.

3. DESCRIPTION OF THE 50 SELECTED FEATURES
------------------------------------------
NOTE: for the precise implementation of features computation refer to src/utils/extractFeaturesAsTable_v3.m

[WAVELET DOMAIN FEATURES (CWT - Continuous Wavelet Transform)]
Extracted across 8 frequency bands (B1 to B8) to capture non-stationary dynamics.

- CWT_Mean_Acc/Gyr_Bx: Statistical mean of the wavelet coefficients in band x.
- CWT_Eng_Acc/Gyr_Bx: Total energy (sum of squares) of coefficients in band x.
- CWT_Std_Acc/Gyr_Bx: Standard deviation (variability) of coefficients in band x.
- CWT_Entropy_Acc/Gyr_Bx: Shannon entropy of the wavelet energy distribution.

[FREQUENCY DOMAIN FEATURES (FFT Based)]
- En1 to En10_Acc/Gyr: Spectral energy calculated within specific frequency bins.
- SpecEntropyAcc/Gyr: Spectral entropy, measuring the complexity of the 
  power spectrum distribution.
- MedianFreqAcc: Median frequency of the power spectral density.
- MeanFreqGyr: Average frequency weighted by the power spectrum.
- DomPowerAcc/Gyr: Power level of the dominant frequency component.
- HarmonicRatioAcc: Ratio measuring signal periodicity vs. noise.

[TIME DOMAIN & STATISTICAL FEATURES]
- MeanAcc/Gyr: Average magnitude of the sensor vector.
- VarGyr: Variance of the gyroscope signal (intensity of rotation).
- SkewAcc/Gyr: Skewness (measure of distribution asymmetry).
- KurtGyr: Kurtosis (measure of "peakedness" or outliers in the distribution).
- IQRGyr: Interquartile Range, providing a robust measure of signal spread.
- MedCrossRateAcc/Gyr: Frequency of signal crossings over the median value.
- NumPeaksGyr: Number of local maxima (peaks) detected within the 10s window.
- ACF10_Gyr: 10th coefficient of the Autocorrelation Function.
- GyroAccCorr: Correlation coefficient between the magnitudes of the 
  accelerometer and gyroscope.

4. METADATA SUMMARY
-------------------
The primary target variable is 'Position' (col. 164), which labels the location 
of the device on the body (e.g., hand, pocket, bag). Other metadata include 
demographic data (Age, Gender) and hardware specs (DeviceModel, OS).
