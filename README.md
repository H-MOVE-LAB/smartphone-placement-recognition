# MATLAB Project Template

Template repository for **reproducible scientific MATLAB projects** developed
within the **H-MOVE-LAB**.

This repository provides a standard project structure and example scripts that
illustrate the recommended workflow for MATLAB-based research projects.

---

## Coding guidelines

This template follows the coding principles defined in the
**H-MOVE-LAB Coding Manifesto**:

https://github.com/H-MOVE-LAB/lab-coding-guidelines

All new MATLAB projects in the lab are expected to start from this template or
to align with the same structure and principles.

## Project structure

```text
.
├─ setup.m
├─ scripts/
├─ src/
├─ results/
└─ data/
```

## Getting started

From the repository root, open MATLAB and run: scripts/RunPipeline  
Then run: scripts/RunAnalysis  
The example scripts demonstrate:
- how to set up paths and folders
- how to structure pipelines and analyses
- how to save reproducible outputs

## Scope

This repository is intended as a starting point for new projects. Scientific results and datasets should live in project-specific repositories.
